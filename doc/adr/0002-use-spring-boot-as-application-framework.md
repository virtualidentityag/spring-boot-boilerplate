# Choice of Java application framework 

## Context and Problem Statement
There are many possibilities and frameworks to build enterprise applications with Java.
Which one we want to use?

## Considered Options

* Spring Boot
* no framework
* other frameworks (like Quarkus)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Spring Boot", because 

* Spring Boot is a stable, proven framework with an excellent documentation and a huge community
* provides many curated starter modules for common integration use cases (like JPA, Solr...)
* Virtual Identity has the most experience with this framework
* Other Java-based frameworks do not provide an additional killer feature
